# Fractal-based Wireless Mesh Network Topology


This repository provides tools to generate spatially embedded fractal topologies for Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs).


## 📌 Overview

Fractal topologies introduce spatial self-similarity into node placement, enabling a unique investigation of how fractal dimension \( D \) affects network performance. This framework replicates the simulations described in our paper:

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `src/`: Source code for generating topologies and analyzing performance.
- `data/`: Example fractal point clouds.
- `figures/`: Visualizations of fractal networks.
