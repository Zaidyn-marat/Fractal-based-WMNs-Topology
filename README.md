# Fractal-based Wireless Mesh Network Topology

This repository provides tools to generate spatially embedded fractal topologies for Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), simulate network performance using NS-3, and analyze results including throughput, delay, jitter, and energy consumption.

## 📌 Overview

Fractal topologies introduce spatial self-similarity into node placement, enabling a unique investigation of how fractal dimension \( D \) affects network performance. This framework replicates the simulations described in our paper:
